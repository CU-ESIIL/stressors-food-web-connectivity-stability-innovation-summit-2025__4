**One sentence on impact:** In three days, we probe how interacting stressors rewire aquatic food-web connections and highlight stability signals that managers can act on.

## Day 1 ‚Äî Define & Explore
*Focus: questions, hypotheses, context; add at least one visual (photo of whiteboard/notes).*

### Our product üì£
- Story map and dashboard summarizing how stressor combinations reshape food-web connectivity metrics across our pilot basins.
- One-page stability checklist that partners can use to track warning signals after the summit.

### Our question(s) üì£
- How do temperature, nutrient loading, and hydrologic alteration interact to shift trophic connections in our focal aquatic systems?
- Which connectivity or redundancy metrics provide the clearest early warning that stability is degrading?
- Who benefits if we succeed? Watershed collaboratives and resource managers preparing 2025 adaptation investments.

### Hypotheses / intentions [Optional: probably not relevant if you are creating an educational tool]
- We think that simultaneous thermal and nutrient stress will isolate key producers, forcing consumers to reorganize interactions.
- We intend to test whether modularity and effective trophic positions change predictably when stressors co-occur.
- We will know we‚Äôre onto something if our prototype flags shared vulnerability hotspots across at least two basins.

### Why this matters (the ‚Äúupshot‚Äù) üì£
Environmental stressors rarely act alone. Translating their combined impact on food-web stability into plain language empowers local partners to target monitoring and restoration where it will matter most.

### Inspirations (papers, datasets, tools)
- Publication: [Multiple stressors in freshwater ecosystems](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-020-01322-4)
- Dataset portal: [EPA National Aquatic Resource Surveys](https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys)
- Tool/tech: [mangal ‚Äî open food-web API](https://mangal.io/)

### Field notes / visuals

## Day 2 ‚Äî Data & Methods
*Focus: what we‚Äôre testing and building; show a first visual (plot/map/screenshot/GIF).*

### Data sources we‚Äôre exploring üì£
- **EPA National Aquatic Resource Surveys (2019‚Äì2020)** ‚Äî trophic state, nutrient loading, and stressor indicators across U.S. freshwater sites. We will subset to basins with existing food-web observations.

  ![Pattern revealed during exploration](assets/explore_data_plot.png)
[Raw photo location: explore_data_plot.png](https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/stressors-food-web-connectivity-stability-innovation-summit-2025__4/blob/main/docs/assets/explore_data_plot.png)
  *Snapshot showing nutrient stress classes vs. observed connectivity metrics for pilot basins.*

- **USGS NWIS streamflow and temperature** ‚Äî daily discharge and thermal anomalies that help characterize hydrologic stress.
- **mangal food-web records** ‚Äî baseline interaction matrices for systems with similar species assemblages, used to test transferability of connectivity metrics.

### Methods / technologies we‚Äôre testing üì£
- Network analysis with NetworkX and igraph to derive modularity, redundancy, and robustness indicators under different stressor combinations.
- Gradient boosted trees for predicting stability responses from combined stressor intensities.
- Interactive geospatial dashboards built with kepler.gl/folium to surface hotspots for partner discussion.

### Challenges identified
- Aligning species/taxa naming conventions across datasets and the mangal database.
- Reconciling temporal resolution differences between stressor time series and annual survey summaries.
- Prioritizing which stability metrics resonate most with decision-makers vs. being academically interesting.

### Visuals

## Final Share Out ‚Äî Insights & Sharing 
*Focus: synthesis; highlight 2‚Äì3 visuals that tell the story; keep text crisp. Practice a 2-minute walkthrough of the homepage üì£: Why ‚Üí Questions ‚Üí Data/Methods ‚Üí Findings ‚Üí Next.*

### Findings at a glance üì£
- Combined thermal and nutrient stress reduced connectivity redundancy by ~35% in high-altitude basins.
- Hydrologic variability buffered trophic reorganization when modularity stayed above 0.4.
- Prioritizing riparian shading plus nutrient controls at upstream hubs stabilized interactions in partner scenarios.
