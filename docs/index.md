**One sentence on impact:** In three days, we probe how interacting stressors rewire aquatic food-web connections and highlight stability signals that managers can act on.

## Day 1 ‚Äî Define & Explore
*Focus: questions, hypotheses, context; add at least one visual (photo of whiteboard/notes).*

### Our product üì£
- Future publication
- Conceptual progress towards an ESIIL Working Group application

### Our question(s) üì£
- How do multiple stressors impact food web connectivity in aquatic systems, and at what threshold of connectivity do we pass a tipping point?
- Can food web connectivity be used as a predictor of tipping points?
- Does relative abundance at each trophic level signal tipping points?


### Hypotheses / intentions [Optional: probably not relevant if you are creating an educational tool]
- If the number of food web connections approximates stability, then loss of some number of connections over a threshold will result in a significantly different food web composition.
- Addition of multiple stressors will lead to a switch in trophic cascade structure (bottom-up versus top-down systems).
- Addition of multiple stressors will shift food webs to contain a higher proportion of generalist species. 

### Why this matters (the ‚Äúupshot‚Äù) üì£
Aquatic places have a lot of value - food, recreation, biodiversity, and more. Freshwater lakes are under threat from multiple stressors including changing temperatures, pH, nutrients, invaisve species, and human impact, which threaten those values.

### Inspirations (papers, datasets, tools)
- Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation/EPA water quality datasets: [Lake Champlain data](https://anrweb.vermont.gov/dec/_dec/LongTermMonitoringLakes.aspx?_gl=1*1gvj1mr*_ga*ODAxMzU1NjYwLjE3NTg2NTY5NTk.*_ga_V9WQH77KLW*czE3NTg2NTY5NTkkbzEkZzEkdDE3NTg2NTcyNzYkajYwJGwwJGgw)

### Field notes / visuals
<!-- EDIT: Replace with a real smartphone photo or sketch; keep filename simple. -->

*Initial whiteboard brainstorm of a basic foodweb*

> **Different perspectives:** Briefly capture disagreements or alternate framings. These can unlock innovation.

## Day 2 ‚Äî Data & Methods
*Focus: what we‚Äôre testing and building; show a first visual (plot/map/screenshot/GIF).*

### Data sources we‚Äôre exploring üì£
<!-- EDIT: Link each source; add size/notes if relevant. -->
- Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation/EPA water quality datasets: [Lake Champlain data](https://anrweb.vermont.gov/dec/_dec/LongTermMonitoringLakes.aspx?_gl=1*1gvj1mr*_ga*ODAxMzU1NjYwLjE3NTg2NTY5NTk.*_ga_V9WQH77KLW*czE3NTg2NTY5NTkkbzEkZzEkdDE3NTg2NTcyNzYkajYwJGwwJGgw) Physical, chemical, and biological observations including nutrients, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and biological species

### Methods / technologies we‚Äôre testing üì£
- Parameterize a simulated food web using observed data from Lake Champlain.
- In simulated model, introduce stressors such as changes to temperature, pollution (e.g., nutrients), invasive species, etc.
- Calculate food web metrics such as connectivity, number of nodes, stability, etc. before and after introduction of stressors.
- Determine if and where thresholds exist before food web metrics display food web collapse.

### Challenges identified
- Data gaps / quality issues:
  1. Site IDs don't seem to match to consistent locations.
  2. Site IDs are differen't between the Vermont DEC website and the EPA API (where we actually stream data from), making it difficult to get a handle on what sites we are looking at.
  3. Zooplankton is missing from the Lake Champlain dataset, which are crucial taxa to include in a freshwater food web.
- Method limitations / compute constraints
  1. How do we make a basic, but also realistic, simulated food web to test effects of stressors?
- Open questions we need to decide on
  1. How complex of a food web do we simulate?
  2. Which stressors do we include in the system?
  3. Do we expand outside of Lake Champlain? If so, where do we find those data?

### Visuals
