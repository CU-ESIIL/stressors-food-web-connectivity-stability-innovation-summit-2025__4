**One sentence on impact:** In three days, we probe how interacting stressors rewire aquatic food-web connections and highlight stability signals that managers can act on.

## Day 1 ‚Äî Define & Explore
*Focus: questions, hypotheses, context; add at least one visual (photo of whiteboard/notes).*

### Our product üì£
- Future publication
- Conceptual progress towards an ESIIL Working Group application

### Our question(s) üì£
- How do multiple stressors impact food web connectivity in aquatic systems, and at what threshold of connectivity do we pass a tipping point?
- Can food web connectivity be used as a predictor of tipping points?
- Does relative abundance at each trophic level signal tipping points?


### Hypotheses / intentions [Optional: probably not relevant if you are creating an educational tool]
- If the number of food web connections approximates stability, then loss of some number of connections over a threshold will result in a significantly different food web composition.
- Addition of multiple stressors will lead to a switch in trophic cascade structure (bottom-up versus top-down systems).
- Addition of multiple stressors will shift food webs to contain a higher proportion of generalist species. 

### Why this matters (the ‚Äúupshot‚Äù) üì£
Aquatic places have a lot of value - food, recreation, biodiversity, and more. Freshwater lakes are under threat from multiple stressors including changing temperatures, pH, nutrients, invaisve species, and human impact, which threaten those values.

### Inspirations (papers, datasets, tools)
- Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation/EPA water quality datasets: [Lake Champlain data](https://anrweb.vermont.gov/dec/_dec/LongTermMonitoringLakes.aspx?_gl=1*1gvj1mr*_ga*ODAxMzU1NjYwLjE3NTg2NTY5NTk.*_ga_V9WQH77KLW*czE3NTg2NTY5NTkkbzEkZzEkdDE3NTg2NTcyNzYkajYwJGwwJGgw)

### Field notes / visuals
<!-- EDIT: Replace with a real smartphone photo or sketch; keep filename simple. -->

*Initial whiteboard brainstorm of a basic foodweb*

> **Different perspectives:** Briefly capture disagreements or alternate framings. These can unlock innovation.

## Day 2 ‚Äî Data & Methods
*Focus: what we‚Äôre testing and building; show a first visual (plot/map/screenshot/GIF).*

### Data sources we‚Äôre exploring üì£
![Lake Champlain Monitoring Sites](assets/LakeChamplainMap.png)
[Raw photo location: LakeChamplainMap.png](https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/stressors-food-web-connectivity-stability-innovation-summit-2025__4/blob/main/docs/assets/LakeChamplainMap.png)

<!-- EDIT: Link each source; add size/notes if relevant. -->
- Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation/EPA water quality datasets: [Lake Champlain data](https://anrweb.vermont.gov/dec/_dec/LongTermMonitoringLakes.aspx?_gl=1*1gvj1mr*_ga*ODAxMzU1NjYwLjE3NTg2NTY5NTk.*_ga_V9WQH77KLW*czE3NTg2NTY5NTkkbzEkZzEkdDE3NTg2NTcyNzYkajYwJGwwJGgw) Physical, chemical, and biological observations including nutrients, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and biological species
-EPA Great Lakes Data repository GLENDA: [Great Lakes Data Repository] (https://cdxapps.epa.gov/cdx-glenda/action/querytool/querySystem)

### Methods / technologies we‚Äôre testing üì£
- Parameterize a simulated food web using observed data from Lake Champlain.
- In simulated model, introduce stressors such as changes to temperature, pollution (e.g., nutrients), invasive species, etc.
- Calculate food web metrics such as connectivity, number of nodes, stability, etc. before and after introduction of stressors.
- Determine if and where thresholds exist before food web metrics display food web collapse.

### Challenges identified
**Data gaps / quality issues:**
> 1. Site IDs don't seem to match to consistent locations.
> 2. Site IDs are differen't between the Vermont DEC website and the EPA API (where we actually stream data from), making it difficult to get a handle on what sites we are looking at.
> 3. Zooplankton is missing from the Lake Champlain dataset, which are crucial taxa to include in a freshwater food web.

**Method limitations / compute constraints**
> 1. How do we make a basic, but also realistic, simulated food web to test effects of stressors?

**Open questions we need to decide on**
> 1. How complex of a food web do we simulate?
> 2. Which stressors do we include in the system?
> 3. Do we expand outside of Lake Champlain? If so, where do we find those data?

### Visuals

### Findings at a glance üì£
- Freshwater lakes provide important values to humans and ecosystems. It is imperative that resource managers understand food webs and the threats that can alter them.
- Lake Champlain has multiple stressors acting on food webs including warming temperatures, nutrient inputs, and invasive species introductions.
- Invasive species invasions can be detected from figures
- Scale matters! E.g., phosphorus varies at different depths.

### What‚Äôs next? üì£
- Aquire more relevant data (e.g., zooplankton data from collaborator)
- Harmonize data
- Identify all stressors that affect Lake Champlain
- Refine scope
- Develop ESIIL Working Group application
- Future publication!
